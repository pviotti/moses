## Wish list / TODOs

Short term tasks:

 - [x] use uniform make-based automation
 - [ ] better logging (thread id, op., invoke/response,...)
 - [ ] try CAS on a single list of integers as in jepsen

Long/medium term goals:

 - [ ] include other stores - ex.: MongoDB, Riak, Infinispan
 - [ ] add test for consistency models (e.g. linearizability, causal)
 
 
Note:
change default docker image to Alpine
